title: Introduction to Dicot
---

The high level goal of the project is to build a REST API service which allows
[OpenStack](https://openstack.org) compatible clients to work with
[KubeVirt](https://kubevirt.github.io) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
to run [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org) virtual machines.

The goal is that the combination of Kubernetes and KubeVirt provide converged
infrastructure and API services for managing application container workloads
and virtual machines, while Dicot provides compatibility for applications
built against the widely used OpenStack API.
